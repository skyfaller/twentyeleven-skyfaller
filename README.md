# README
This is a [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/) of the Wordpress theme [Twenty Eleven](http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/twentyeleven/). It was created for [Skyfaller.space](http://skyfaller.space), Nelson's personal homepage. 

## Font
I use @font-face to import an open source font from [The League of Moveable Type](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/), specifically [Orbitron](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/orbitron), to use in the header. I used [google-webfonts-helper](https://github.com/majodev/google-webfonts-helper) to download only the style I need from Google Fonts.

I'd like to [de-Google my sites](https://markosaric.com/degoogleify/), and [self-hosting seems to provide better performance than Google Fonts](https://www.tunetheweb.com/blog/should-you-self-host-google-fonts/).
